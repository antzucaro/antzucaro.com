  <p>On a winter day in February 2005 I found myself with a day off and figure I'd go check out <a href="http://www.nps.gov/mana/">Manassas National Battlefield Park</a>. I'd read so much about it, so I had to see what the field looked like today, over 140 years later!</p>
<p>Even though the ground was covered in snow and the battle actually happened in July (specifically the 21st in 1861), I was still excited thinking about the crucial events that happened there. The conflict at Manassas was the first full-scale battle of the war, and it was a huge shock for the Union. It was the battle in which Thomas J. Jackson got his nickname (Stonewall) and one that sent a grim reminder to the Union that the Confederacy was not a small insurrection.</p>
<p>Right behind the visitor center you'll find this huge statue of Stonewall himself:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_012.jpg"><img class=" " title="Stonewall Jackson" src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_012.jpg" alt="Stonewall Jackson" width="629" height="418" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stonewall Jackson</p></div>

<p>Over those hills in the distance citizens and politicians from nearby DC came out to watch the battle with their picnic lunches. Little did they know they'd soon be running for their lives from the cannon and musket fire before the day was through. Jackson lined his troops up just behind this statue, waiting to regroup the crumbling Confederate line. At just the right time he was able to put a stop to the Union advance. Later that day Confederate reinforcements arrived from the West who then crushed into the Union right flank, sending them in disarray back to the gates of Washington. The battle ended with the Confederates holding the field and the Union troops running.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the present day. Here's another view of Stonewall's statue. Note how ridiculously huge he looks - almost as if from a comic book:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 418px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_010.jpg"><img class=" " title="Super-Stonewall" src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_010.jpg" alt="Super-Stonewall" width="418" height="629" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Super-Stonewall</p></div>

<p>Here's some shot of the cannon positions behind the statues:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_014.jpg"><img class=" " title="Cannon positions" src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_014.jpg" alt="Cannon positions" width="629" height="418" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cannon positions</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">And here's a close up look at those tools of mass destruction:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_016.jpg"><img class=" " title="They go &quot;boom&quot;" src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_016.jpg" alt="They go &quot;boom&quot;" width="629" height="418" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">They go &quot;boom&quot;</p></div>

<p>Back to the past - a lot of the fighting centered around Henry Hill on that day. One sad thing is that the elderly inhabitant of the house on that hill - Judith Henry - became the first civilian to die during the battle when a shell went off near her bed (from which she could not leave due to her age). Here is her house reconstructed:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_022.jpg"><img class=" " title="Henry House" src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_022.jpg" alt="Henry House" width="629" height="418" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Henry House</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">Up closer to the house you'll find the Union memorial there which was dedicated in 1865:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_030.jpg"><img class=" " title="Memorial at Manassas" src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_030.jpg" alt="Memorial at Manassas" width="629" height="418" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Memorial at Manassas</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">Here's a closer look:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 418px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_031.jpg"><img class=" " title="A little closer" src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_031.jpg" alt="A little closer" width="418" height="629" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A little closer</p></div>

<p>But wait, there's more! Here's an even closer look. If you can't tell, I like old stuff. I find it fascinating!
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 418px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_035.jpg"><img class=" " title="Whoa, that's close." src="http://antzucaro.com/20050225Manassas/Manassas_035.jpg" alt="Whoa, that's close." width="418" height="629" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Whoa, that&#39;s close.</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately that's all the photos I could come up with on my day off - I think I just got too cold to take any more! In any case I'll have to go back sometime soon to get a more in depth overview of the field and its features.</p>

  <p>I visited Gettysburg with Kristin back in January 2008 after a few days of snow. It was gorgeous out there, mainly because everyone else decided to stay at home rather than explore the battlefield in the freezing weather. It really gave us a chance to experience the land and think about what happened there back in 1863.</p>
<p>The visitor's center is located in the center of the Union line, close to where Meade's headquarters were located. George Meade assumed command of the Army of Potomac on June 28, 1863 just a few days before the battle began in earnest on July 1st. A statue of him is right behind the building:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_011.jpg"><img class=" " title="General George Meade" src="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_011.jpg" alt="General George Meade" width="629" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">General George Meade</p></div>

<p>Going further away from the center is what's known as "The Bloody Angle." This spot was the scene of some desperate hand-to-hand combat during the peak of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickett%27s_Charge">Pickett's Charge</a>:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_022.jpg"><img class=" " title="The Angle" src="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_022.jpg" alt="The Angle" width="629" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Angle</p></div>

<p>It is hard to envision such carnage in someone's back yard, but in fact that's exactly how it was - this shot gives a little perspective:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_046.jpg"><img class=" " title="Farm near a memorial" src="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_046.jpg" alt="Farm near a memorial" width="629" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Farm near a memorial</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">Given that Gettysburg is often called the turning point of the Civil War, and paired with the sheer amount of men lost there, you can imagine the large number of monuments and memorials there. Pennsylvania (in the background) has the largest monument on the battlefield:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 419px"><a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_039.jpg"><img class=" " title="PA memorial" src="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_039.jpg" alt="PA memorial" width="419" height="629" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">PA memorial</p></div>

<p>On the second day of the battle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Den">Devil's Den</a> was a hotbed of activity as General Hood's division charged up through it heading towards Little Round Top. This is the view facing Southwest:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_096.jpg"><img class=" " title="Devil's Den" src="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_096.jpg" alt="Devil's Den" width="629" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Devil&#39;s Den</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">People often see this photograph in books on the Civil War (it was staged, FYI):</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 680px"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Confederate_Dead_at_Devil%27s_Den_Gettysburg.jpg/755px-Confederate_Dead_at_Devil%27s_Den_Gettysburg.jpg"><img class=" " title="The Confederate &quot;sharpshooter&quot;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Confederate_Dead_at_Devil%27s_Den_Gettysburg.jpg/755px-Confederate_Dead_at_Devil%27s_Den_Gettysburg.jpg" alt="The Confederate &quot;sharpshooter&quot;" width="680" height="540" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Confederate &quot;sharpshooter&quot;</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">Here is that same spot today:</p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_119.jpg"><img class=" " title="The same spot today" src="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_119.jpg" alt="The same spot today" width="629" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The same spot today</p></div>

<p>Past Devil's Den on the southern part of the battlefield is Little Round Top, where the 20th Maine made its famous charge to effectively end the Confederate attack on the second day. Here's the view from the top of Little Round Top, with a statue of General Warren looking out to the West:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_135.jpg"><img class=" " title="Summit of Little Round Top" src="http://www.antzucaro.com/20080127Gettysburg/Gettysburg_135.jpg" alt="Summit of Little Round Top" width="629" height="419" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Summit of Little Round Top</p></div>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>As I've mentioned <a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/2010/11/abcde-a-better-cd-encoder/">before</a>, about two summers back I went through my whole CD collection and digitized it to MP3 format using a tool called ABCDE. What I didn't mention in that post was that at the time I'd forgotten to create playlists automatically during the process. Bummer! I had all of these albums digitized, but whenever I wanted to play a particular album I'd have to add the folder through my music player or manually select all of the files to add to my playlist. That wasn't too bad, but if you've had any experience with playlists in Windows Media Player, VLC, or even XMMS you'll know that in practice it is just a pain to handle. For whatever reason it may be, the ordering of the album tracks on the playlist <em><strong>always</strong></em> gets messed up when adding manually or via folders. <em><strong>Always!</strong></em> Now, I know I can fix this simply by sorting by the ID3 metadata (click the "track number" column in most players to sort), but the point is that <em>I shouldn't have to do this</em>. I wanted a simple solution.</p>
<p>I get annoyed with these things pretty quickly, so I started thinking about how I could remedy the situation to save myself some time. Obviously I could investigate <em>why </em>each of the players were failing to sort my properly named (and usually tagged) files, but that seemed like too much work. I thought a simple solution would be to create M3U (a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FM3U&amp;rct=j&amp;q=m3u&amp;ei=sMnWTOWRFMP-8AaXnPmZBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHVxaaNTKNnCiADQmd33edsMs0o4A&amp;sig2=OU39DvcsU8FPv3XmFXfiiQ&amp;cad=rja">standard</a> playlist format) playlist files in each album directory that would contain the exact track ordering of that particular album. That way to play an album all I'd need to do was double click on the playlist file and <em>voila!</em> it would play it in the right order. This would also give me the ability to drag and drop multiple albums without having to worry about sort issues with having multiple track 1s (not too much of a problem with today's players, but still).</p>
<p>I did a little research and found a tool to help me write the playlists. It's a Python library called <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CBkQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fmutagen%2F&amp;rct=j&amp;q=mutagen&amp;ei=FsvWTPb9IoT48AblrMjYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNHzts_jR6qh9C_NtJi1COJQEfqHWQ&amp;sig2=eoawYstMNOwkQafn61uG1g&amp;cad=rja">mutagen</a>, and it basically allowed me to programmatically read the metadata of Mp3 files to get the following information (among the many other things it can retrieve):
<ul>
    <li>Track number</li>
    <li>Artist name</li>
    <li>Album name</li>
    <li>Track length (seconds)</li>
</ul>
After installing mutagen, I wrote the following Python script (m3u.py) to traverse through a set of directories and create playlist files at the lowest level. For example, if I ran it on <em>/home/ant/Music/Coldplay/Parachutes</em> I would end up with a playlist file inside the <em>Parachutes</em> directory:</p>
<p>[python]</p>
<h1>!/usr/bin/python</h1>
<p>import os
import sys
import glob
from mutagen.mp3 import MP3
from mutagen.easyid3 import EasyID3</p>
<p>def makem3u(dir=&quot;.&quot;):
    try:
        print &quot;Processing directory '%s'.&quot; % dir
        os.chdir(dir)</p>
<pre><code>    # get ID3 meta objects for each mp3,
    # store in a list
    playlist = ''
    mp3s = []
    for file in glob.glob(&amp;quot;*.[mM][pP]3&amp;quot;):
        if playlist == '':
            playlist = EasyID3(file)['album'][0] + '.m3u'
        meta_info = {
            'filename': file,
            'length': int(MP3(file).info.length),
            'tracknumber': EasyID3(file)['tracknumber'][0].split('/')[0],
        }
        mp3s.append(meta_info)

    if len(mp3s) &amp;gt; 0:
        print &amp;quot;Writing playlist %s.&amp;quot; % playlist

        # write the playlist
        of = open(playlist, 'w')
        of.write(&amp;quot;#EXTM3U\n&amp;quot;)

        # sorted by track number
        for mp3 in sorted(mp3s, key=lambda mp3: int(mp3['tracknumber'])):
            of.write(&amp;quot;#EXTINF:%s,%s\n&amp;quot; % (mp3['length'], mp3['filename']))
            of.write(mp3['filename'] + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;)

        of.close()

except:
    print &amp;quot;Error when trying to process directory '%s'. Ignoring...&amp;quot; % dir
    print &amp;quot;Text:&amp;quot;, sys.exc_info()[0]
</code></pre>
<p>def main(argv = None):
    if argv is None:
        argv = sys.argv</p>
<pre><code># directories containing music files
dirs = []

if len(sys.argv) == 2 and sys.argv[1] == '-':
# we do not have command line arguments,
# so read from STDIN
   for line in sys.stdin:
       dirs.append(line.strip())
else:
# passed in directories on the command line
    for dir in sys.argv[1:]:
        dirs.append(dir)

# for each directory passed to us, go
# to it and make the M3U out of the
# MP3 files there
for dir in dirs:
    makem3u(dir)

return 0
</code></pre>
<p>if <strong>name</strong> == &quot;<strong>main</strong>&quot;:
    sys.exit(main())
[/python]</p>
<p>You can pass directories two ways this script - as arguments or via standard input. This allows me to do this:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">m3u.py /home/ant/Music/Coldplay/Parachutes</pre>

<p>...or if I wanted to do a bunch of directories in bulk:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">find /home/ant/Music -type d -links 2 | m3u.py - </pre>

<p>Note that I made only a small attempt to make this script bulletproof. It gives a decent attempt to find the metadata in the MP3 files it finds in the directory, but if it encounters an error thrown by mutagen it dies out with an error message telling me the directory that failed and the exception it hit. Nine times out of ten (in my testing) the script will die because the tag information in the MP3s are malformed, which means that you wouldn't want to create a playlist off of them using that info anyway.</p>
<p>When I ran this script on the 127 albums on my laptop, I only had 12 fail (of course YMMV depending on how your collection is set up). A 90% success rate for me to avoid futzing w/ files in my media player is worth it! Plus, I had fun figuring out and learning something new in the process.</p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p>I'm a big fan of automating things. In almost all aspects of my life you can find an example of me trying to free up some of my time by eliminating the mundane, repeatable steps with some automated process (think auto-billpay and programmable coffee makers). This is even more evident in my computer work - I don't want to be typing in the same commands over and over! For one, all of that typing takes time, and time is something of which I have too little. For two, me having to manually type or click things out each time exposes whatever I'm doing to human error.</p>
<p>In this post I'd like to talk about one example of automation that I've used to save a lot of time: archiving of my CDs to MP3. I did this about two summers back when I was trying to archive my entire collection to an external hard drive I'd just bought (over 300 CDs between myself and my wife). My goal was to rip them all with:
<ul>
    <li>The same level of quality (the highest quality variable bitrate MP3)</li>
    <li>The same folder structure (&lt;Artist&gt;/&lt;Album&gt;/&lt;Artist&gt; - &lt;Track Number&gt; - &lt;Track Name&gt;.mp3)</li>
    <li>Meaningful meta-info (IDv3 tags)</li>
    <li>Playlists in the album folder (M3U files)</li>
</ul>
I started with a program called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K3b">K3B</a> that was more than adequate in terms of my goals above, but it just took too long. After about 10 CDs I realized that the amount time to rip this way wasn't feasible (even with two CD drives to work with in the tower I was using). To Google I went, eventually finding a neat little program called ABCDE that seemed to fit the bill.
<h2>Enter ABCDE</h2>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/abcde/">ABCDE</a> is a deceptively simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29">Bash</a> script that packs a whole host of features: Mp3/FLAC/Ogg ripping, playlists, CDDB lookups, and file tagging. What made me choose it over everything else wasn't its feature set per se, but rather that it can be customized and simplified such that you don't have to type out your preferences every time; you essentially set up your preferences in a configuration file <em><strong>once</strong></em>, then forget about them! In the end I had my setup customized so that all I needed to do to rip my CDs was one of the following commands (depending on which drive the CD was loaded, of course):</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">
ripcd
ripdvd
</pre>

<p>How did I get to that point, you ask? Configuration, of course! Read on...
<h2>Configuring ABCDE</h2>
After you install it (which I won't cover here), ABCDE stores its default configuration in the appropriately named <em>/etc/abcde.conf</em>.  I started off by editing this file to make sure that it did things exactly the way I wanted (see my goals above).  Here's an annotated guide of what I changed in the default setup.
<h3>Allow track padding</h3>
The visual presentation of my music files is important to me. This includes how they are sorted when they are sitting in their respective folders - I wanted them to be in the folder in the same order as they are in the album! By default ABCDE doesn't pad their track numbers (should you put them in the filename), which leads to track number "10" being shown before track number "1" if the track number is the first significant difference to the file names. Padding the track names solves this issue (it makes track 1 appear with "01" in the filename) and provides me a consistent representation in my file browser. To enable this, make this change in your config:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">PADTRACKS=y</pre>

<h3>MP3 Encoding Parameters</h3>

<p>To get the highest quality encoding out of ABCDE I have the following LAME option (LAME is what ABCDE uses to create MP3s):</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">LAMEOPTS=&quot;-b 320&quot;</pre>

<p>Let me say here that encoding parameters are extremely subjective. Some folks want lossless,  while others want huge space savings. What I want is the best possible  quality while staying within the constraints of the MP3 file format. I  do that because I think lossless (FLAC) just takes up too much space. I'm also lazy in that I don't  want to convert to MP3 if I have it archived in a different format. If you are interested in exploring other MP3 options for ABCDE here, check out the <a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=LAME">Hydrogenaudio Wiki</a> for a pretty succinct breakdown of the other LAME options.
<h3>Output Location</h3>
When I rip a CD, I want all of the output to go to a common location. That way I know where to look when (not if) things go wrong! Change the following options to specify where you'd like your files to go. Here I'm storing them in my home directory.</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">OUTPUTDIR=/home/ant
WAVOUTPUTDIR=/home/ant/tmp</pre>

<p>You may want to change up your temporary directory to go to a more <em>temporary</em> location like /tmp. For me I just keep it there.
<h3>Output Format</h3>
Here's where things get fun. Everyone has their own file naming scheme, and rightfully so. They are your files after all, right? I like to have the artist name as a top level directory, followed by the album name in another directory under that. For the actual music files (which get placed in the album folder), I like to - again - put the artist in the name in case I want to copy just those files to a USB drive. Here is the setting to make ABCDE create this structure:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">OUTPUTFORMAT='${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ARTISTFILE} - ${TRACKNUM} - ${TRACKFILE}'

VAOUTPUTFORMAT='${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ARTISTFILE} - ${TRACKNUM} - ${TRACKFILE}'</pre>

<p>Note that there are two lines there. The first line is for normal albums with only one artist. The second is for music compilations where you have several different artists on the same CD. This is one area that I wish ABCDE did a little better - ideally I'd like to be able to specify my own "album artist" name instead of having folders for each artist on the CD, but I have another solution for that which I'll cover in another post. For now I'm content with that flaw because I rarely purchase compilations.
<h3>Playlists</h3>
As I said before, I want M3U playlists automatically whenever I rip a CD. This gives me a simple, one-click solution to playing an album without having to mess with bad sorting in whatever music player I'm using at the time (they all seem to mess it up). First, use this option to define the format of the M3U playlist. Here I am saying to create the file with the album as it's name, to be stored in the album directory:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">PLAYLISTFORMAT='${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}.m3u'

PLAYLISTFORMAT='${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}.m3u'

</pre>

<p>Next, you need to tell ABCDE to actually create the playlist when you rip a CD (it doesn't do this by default). Add this to do that:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">ACTIONS=cddb,read,encode,tag,move,playlist,clean</pre>

<p>Note that there's a lot of other stuff going on before the playlist generation - that's intended.
<h3>Give Me My Space!</h3>
By default ABCDE converts spaces and forward slashes to underscores. I'm fine with the latter, but having underscore in the filename where a space should be is endlessly annoying to me ("Pink Floyd - 03 - Time.mp3" looks much better than "Pink_Floyd_-<em>03</em>-_Time.mp3," don't you think?). It's 2010 for goodness sake! Computers have evolved to be able to handle spaces in file names! Replace the "mungefilename" function with this one to keep your spaces:</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">mungefilename ()
{
 echo &quot;$@&quot; | sed s,:,\ -,g | tr /\* _+ | tr -d \'\&quot;\?\[:cntrl:\]
}</pre>

<h3>Setting Up Aliases</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, when I was using ABCDE heavily two summers ago I had aliases set up for each physical CD drive on my machine. If you don't have two drives, don't worry about this. If you do, and you think you'd get annoyed or tired of typing out which device from which to rip, define these aliases and put them in your ~/.bashrc. You'll want to substitute your actual device names , of course (mine are /dev/dvd and /dev/cdrw):</p>
<pre class="brush:bash;">alias ripcd='abcde -d /dev/cdrw'

alias ripdvd='abcde -d /dev/dvd'</pre>
<h2>All Together Now</h2>
Okay, so now that you have the configuration, let me show you how it looks in practice. Here I've put a CD (Fall Out Boy's worst CD thus far, IMO)  in my CDRW drive and used my alias to start ABCDE. What appears first is the matching CDDB entries:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 682px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-418 " title="After executing &quot;ripcd&quot;" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_1.jpg" alt="After executing &quot;ripcd&quot;" width="682" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">After executing &quot;ripcd&quot;</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">After reviewing which entry looks like the best fit I choose #2 (mainly because it is listed as "rock" and not "misc"):</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 682px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-419 " title="Choosing the second entry" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_2.jpg" alt="Choosing the second entry" width="682" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Choosing the second entry</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">I then answer a couple of questions - do I want to edit the CDDB entry (not this time, but you can with your editor of choice) and is this CD multi-artist (no again) - and it starts ripping:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 682px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-420 " title="Ripping started" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_3.jpg" alt="Ripping started" width="682" height="400" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ripping started</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">When everything is done ABCDE will happily drop you back to your command prompt. Here I'm inspecting the files created after the rip finished. All looks well!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 717px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_4.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-421 " title="Rip/encode done!" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/abcde_4.jpg" alt="Rip/encode done!" width="717" height="441" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rip/encode done!</p></div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Well I hope you've enjoyed this visual and textual tour of what I consider to be a great ripping program: ABCDE. I enjoy automating things in my life, and this handy (and simple) script fits the bill nicely!</p>
