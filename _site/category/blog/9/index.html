<p>Sometimes simply being a parent takes up your day. Yesterday was one such day, when Layla needed constant attention after being awake for a marathon-like (for her) 5 1/2 hours. After playing in the mirror, hanging out in the high chair, and swinging in the swing, she just wanted more! I'd look over at her in the crib after she'd tricked me into thinking she was tired, only to find a big toothless smile and happy eyes looking back at me. What a cutie!</p>
<p>My first reaction after several iterations of this was frustration, but this soon gave way to feelings of guilt. After all, these are the days that I should cherish! Soon she'll be crawling and thereafter will start becoming more and more independent each day. That means what I have right now is so, so special. Having realized that yesterday towards the end of my (our?) ordeal, those feelings of frustration melted away, leaving me there to soak up the experience for what it was.</p>
<p>I have several hobbies - photography, running, Linux, and (ahem) this blog - but none of them are as important as my daughter. I need to remind myself of that each time I complain to myself or someone else about my struggles with parenting. My role as a dad could very well be the most important one in my life! Everything else fades in comparison, and that is the way it is supposed to be.</p>

  <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 640px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rcsaxon/542566756/"><img title="Runners" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/542566756_db45e39778_z.jpg" alt="Runners" width="640" height="480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image courtesy of Richard Saxon</p></div>

<p>I love running; I'm a runner. On weekends, early in the morning, and even during my ever-decreasing lunch breaks, I run. I feel like it gives me the clairvoyance needed to tackle whatever problems I'm having in my life at the moment. As an example, right now I mostly focus on how to solve programming problems by putting them on the back-burner of my mind while my feet hit the pavement repeatedly. It's therapeutic! It's also a huge benefit to your body, but I don't have to tell you that, right? There are a few problems that I have to consider when running, though. Long distance running can be a mind game in which winning means enjoying your run and losing means experiencing pure agony for each centimeter traveled. This post is about handling that mind game.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying that long distance running is completely relative to each person and their experience. I'm sure "long run" to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Salazar">Alberto Salazaar</a> means 20+ miles in a single stretch. It can be relative on other things, too - 5 mile runs seem much longer when you are running in 90 degree, 80% humidity weather, don't they! For purposes of this post my "long" runs are those of 5 miles or longer only because that seems to be a sweet spot.</p>
<p>So here's the thing: when I'm running long distances, I tend to psych myself out when I think too much about how my body is performing. I get into an endless loop of assessment similar to the following:
<ul>
    <li>How is my breathing - is it too rapid, too conversational?</li>
    <li>How is the "chaffage" situation - are my armpits, legs, etc uncomfortable?</li>
    <li>Am I getting enough water, carbs?</li>
    <li>How am I doing on my target pace?</li>
</ul>
While certainly useful in a long race, this constant checking and re-checking makes me <strong>too aware</strong> of any degradations in my performance. Translation: by constantly assessing myself, I find that I actually decrease my performance. Not good! To remedy this self-imposed issue, I employ one or more of the following "mindful running hacks" to keep my mind in check and to get more enjoyment out of my runs. I call them mind<em><strong>ful</strong></em> because they don't really involve your physical self; these things deal exclusively with the battles you can have inside your mind when running long distances. Anyway, here goes...
<ol>
    <li>
<h3><strong>Establish a mantra</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
A mantra is something - a phrase, song, word - that you repeat over and over either physically or mentally to occupy your mind's conscious thoughts; it's really just a big distraction, not at all unlike when you think about your summer vacation (or other happy times) when you are in the dentist's chair. I use mantras to zone out when running. I tend to go with some sort of positive or realistic phrase pertinent to my route. Examples:
<ul>
    <li>This is how I'm <em>supposed </em>to feel</li>
    <li>&lt;insert some lyrics of a song I've been listening to here&gt;</li>
    <li>Calm, cool, collected, <em>confident</em></li>
    <li>X (substitute X with whatever mile/km you are currently on)</li>
</ul>
I find they are effective as such, but relatively boring overall. This means that the longer my run is, the less likely I am to utilize this one. I have to break up the monotony, which leads me to my next point.
<h3><strong>2. Break up the run into chunks</strong></h3>
I break down my long runs into manageable chunks, and I only focusing on one chunk at a time. In the middle of my 10 mile run, I think about the plethora of other 5 mile runs I've completed with no problem. I will myself to forget the miles that are increasingly behind me - what's left is what matters, and what's left is shrinking with each step! I find that I break down my runs into roughly half-mile increments. That's probably a byproduct of my watch's capacity to store lap information, but you can use whatever works for you.
<h3><strong>3. Positive thinking, visualization</strong></h3>
I know, it sounds lame. But if it is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cant-Accept-Not-Trying-Excellence/dp/0062511904/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278002864&amp;sr=8-3">good enough for Michael Jordan</a>, why shouldn't it be good enough for me? I envision my run before and during my actual run. This helps me anticipate how I am going to physically feel as I take step after step. Knowing what to expect mid-race makes me feel more in control, thus boosting my confidence. What I do is think mostly about how my body is going to handle the most difficult portions of a given route - that big up/downhill, the slippery rock or dirt section, etc.  - then I play that section in my head over and over. With repetition comes boredom, so when I actually encounter the obstacle I've been thinking about it doesn't seem so bad.
<h3><strong>4. Use Jeff Galloway's "dirty tricks"</strong></h3>
I have a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marathon-You-Can-Jeff-Galloway/dp/0936070250">"Marathon: You Can Do It!" by Jeff Galloway</a>, the running guru. In it he provides a couple of mind techniques to use that he calls "dirty tricks." All of them are more or less distraction techniques, but I want to bear mention of them here. I've tried each with success, although with a slight bit of embarrassment. The good thing is that no one has to know - it's all in your head!:
<ul>
    <li>Pretend that you and the person in front of you are lashed together with a giant rubber band. Envision the tension of that rubber band is propelling your body forward and past your opponent.</li>
    <li>In an effort to decrease the influence of the right brain when running (which seems to be the dominant half when doing so, for some reason), do math or other analytical (non-logic) problems that help engage your left brain. The idea is to shift the balance between your left and right brains to keep your mind fresh.</li>
    <li>Imagine a giant hand is guiding you through the difficult parts of the race, gently pushing you so as to relieve part of your strain.</li>
    <li>Glide vs. Stride - switch up your stride every once in a while. Go from short, choppy strides to long ones where your feet barely clear the ground. Note: this one isn't just a mental trick. The physical changes help your muscles go longer.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>5. Get Angry</strong></h3>
When I really can't get myself into gear, I imagine things that make me angry. I envision all of my friends laughing at my speed (or lack thereof) or I replay an embarrassing incident in my life. When I do this I feel the immediate need to improve; to prove that those incidents are behind me and I am now a better person. Really though, I tend to use this as a last resort because it is negative thinking.
<h3><strong>In conclusion...</strong></h3>
So there you have it - my list of things I use to make my runs less mind-numbingly difficult. I find that if I use the things I've mentioned here my long runs (those of 5 or more miles, but your YMMV) become enjoyable because I'm not endlessly diagnosing myself and my performance. Rather, I'm focusing on generally positive thoughts or distracting myself altogether. Either way I see a net benefit in becoming more fit and enjoying it all the while!</p>
<p>What do <em><strong>you </strong></em>do to make your runs better? I'd like to know!</p>

  <p>Yesterday on my almost daily walks around Reston Town Center I spotted two new sculptures cropping up in the park across from the Rolls Royce building. From the signs nearby they are made out of recycled wood posts.
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 471px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-198 " title="RTC sculpture 1" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_1.jpg" alt="RTC sculpture 1" width="471" height="630" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The first new sculpture in RTC, fully assembled.</p></div>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-199 " title="RTC sculpture 2" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_2_wip.jpg" alt="RTC sculpture 2" width="472" height="630" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The second new sculpture in RTC.</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is pretty cool how they are propping the red sculpture up - a clue as  to how it may look when finished? I don't know, but it looks good. Here's a picture taken a little while later (the next afternoon):</p>

<p>It doesn't look like they've made much progress, but we'll find out in due time.</p></p>

  <div class="post_prose">
    
  <p><em></em>Those of you who know me personally also know that I had a baby girl this past Easter (Layla, on 4/4). It has been a tiring, stressful, and <em>totally wonderful</em> experience! What I'd like to talk about specifically are the first two points (the tiring and the stressful) and four things I've learned to cope with them. I hope these things will benefit you. If they do, great! If not...well, forget about everything I said and go about doing whatever it was you were going to do anyway :). Here goes...
<h3>1. Sleep when baby sleeps</h3>
When my little girl is crying, my ability to properly diagnose the situation almost entirely depends on how rested I am. I know that the more rested I am, the more clear mind mind will be. Is she hungry? Is she too hot? Does she have gas? I'll never figure it out if my mind is too cloudy. That means it is extremely important for me to get as much sleep as I can.</p>
<p>Therein lies the problem - you don't have much time for sleep. At least I thought I didn't at first. I learned after a few hard weeks that I had to lay down and sleep when Layla went down, else I wouldn't be sleeping at all. Surprisingly, the amount of sleep I was getting after a few weeks of doing this increased dramatically because I was better able to handle/fix whatever was bothering Layla. She'd been giving me the signs all along (turning her head when hungry, kicking her legs when gassy, etc) and I'd just been to tired (or too dumb) to pay attention. Addressing those issues quickly and correctly calmed her down and prevented "meltdowns," which then increased her snooze-time.
<h3><strong>2. Make connections with other people in your same situation</strong></h3>
My wife and I felt alone in the first few weeks after Layla was born. None of our close friends had newborns and we didnâ€™t feel comfortable going to a â€œmommyâ€ or â€œdaddyâ€ meetup in our city. We eventually sucked it up and started scheduling lunches and dinners with other parents who weâ€™d met through mutual friends or work. We figure that doing this created win-win situations for us: we get to talk with people who experience the same issues while making new friends at the same time. Who wouldâ€™ve thought (duh, right)? Plus, I developed a bunch of ideas (or avoided roadblocks altogether) through conversations with these new friends. They really are wonderful exchanges, with each side of the table contributing something or other that makes life with an infant just a little bit easier.</p>
<p>I think all it took was that little connection with the outside world to make us feel like we were still part of something, instead of feeling like we were on an uninhabited island where no one else had kids.
<h3>3. Change up your scenery</h3>
This really goes without saying, but I feel I have to say it anyway: you <strong>have</strong> to change up your surroundings or else you are going to go insane. I am especially prone to cabin fever, but it seemed amplified knowing you have the weight of another human relying on  you 100% on your shoulders. For whatever reason, Kristin and I stayed in the house more often than not. I donâ€™t know what it was that kept us there for so long, but after a while we grew determined to make it easier to go out and about. We critically analyzed our process management science style, which resulted in the following decisions:
<ul>
    <li>We opted against a traditional diaper bag, going with a backpack instead. We already owned a backpack (diaper bags are not cheap, by the way), and it allowed us to have two arms totally free to handle other things.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>We got a portable changing pad like this [http://www.walmart.com/ip/Summer-Infant-ChangeAway-Portable-Changing-Pad-Diaper-Kit/12960886?sourceid=1500000000000003260330&amp;ci_src=14110944&amp;ci_sku=12960886]  and pre-populated it with all of the change stuff weâ€™d need.</li>
    <li>We bought a different, lighter weight stroller for the "quick trips" out. We love our Chicco, but it gets left at home when we're heading to the mall.</li>
    <li>Formula! We used to keep those freezer packs in our bag to keep the milk cold. Nowadays we just bring a pre-measured amount of formula along with bottles with the corresponding amount of water. Hungry baby? Mix, shake, and your done. Many thanks to our neighbors who let us borrow a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sassy-Powdered-Formula-Dispenser-Multiple/dp/B000067PIZ/ref=pd_sbs_misc_2">tupperware formula thingamajig</a> to dispense the formula powder in the least messy fashion.</li>
</ul>
With these changes made, getting out of the house wasn't such a big deal any more. Hooray!
<h3>4. Make daily goals for yourself</h3>
Nothing feels better than checking things off of your TODO list. What I do is make little lists with what I want to accomplish during the day. These become my daily goals which made me feel good about my day when completed. Take note  - these aren't mind-bendingly awesome goals or long term in any way, but rather simple things that moved my new life further a little bit at a time:
<ul>
    <li>Folding the laundry (ugh, what a dreaded task)</li>
    <li>Calling back a friend</li>
    <li>De-cluttering my desk</li>
</ul>
As Bill Murray says in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103241/">What About Bob?</a>: baby steps, baby steps! Checking off those baby steps - no matter how little -  feels <em><strong>good</strong></em>.</p>
<p>So that's what I've done; these four things have helped me transition to being a parent. Babies are stressful, but awesome (especially if you can decrease that stressful part).</p>
