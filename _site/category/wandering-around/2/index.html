  <p>Here are the panoramas that I mentioned yesterday. They were all assembled from multiple photos of the given location, then stitched together using software (about which I'll have to write a post). Click on the images to see a bigger version.</p>
<p>First up is one of the main buildings of Shepherd University. Situated right near the downtown area of Shepherdstown, it attracted all manner of people and dogs. Very cool!
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 720px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstowm_set_3.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-281 " title="Shepherdstown University building" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstowm_set_3.jpg" alt="Shepherdstown University building" width="720" height="487" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shepherd University building</p></div>

<p>Next up is the bridge spanning the river with the bridge remnants:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 719px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstown_set_2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-284 " title="Ruins on the Potomac" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/10/shepherdstown_set_2.jpg" alt="Ruins on the Potomac" width="719" height="248" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ruins on the Potomac</p></div>

<p>Venturing onto the grounds of Antietam National Battlefield, you can see a pretty good reconstruction of some fences surrounding former farmland:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Lastly, and as I mentioned before, here we can see Burnside's Bridge. So much action happened here, but it seemed so tranquil in the fading light. I'm happy I grabbed this series of images before it turned dark on me!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

  <p>What an awesome weekend! To kick things off, my good buddy and fraternity brother Scott stopped by the house en route to a wedding he was attending in nearby Leesburg. We hung around and passed out early on Friday, which allowed us to get up really early (meaning 8AM) for a bike ride into Reston Town Center. We met Kristin and Layla there and had breakfast at the outstanding <a href="http://www.communitycanteen.com/" target="_blank">Community Canteen</a> (get an omelet - you won't be sorry). It was a bit chilly on the way there, but on the way back the temperature warmed up and the day bloomed into something truly fall-ish. The only downside was the strong cross-breeze, which pushed us around on our bikes like it owned us. I will say one thing, though: I didn't help my case by wearing a loose-fitting jacket that acted more like a wind sail.</p>
<p>Sunday morning had Kristin and I champing at the bit to get outside. We bid Scott adieu, then debated going to either Leesburg and Harper's Ferry, but ended up deciding to head down to Shepherdstown, WV instead - I ran a half marathon there about two weeks prior and really enjoyed the surrounding town, and made a pact with Kristin to return (we couldn't explore too much that day because my legs could only carry me so far). To Shepherdstown we went!</p>
<p>We mainly walked around (not wanting to spend too much money), window shopping and site-seeing. I really enjoyed the older buildings and the personalization of the storefronts around the area:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_005.jpg"><img class="  " title="Hand Painted Sign" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_005.jpg" alt="Hand Painted Sign" width="629" height="417" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hand Painted Sign</p></div>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_006.jpg"><img class="  " title="Another custom sign" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_006.jpg" alt="Another custom sign" width="629" height="417" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Another custom sign</p></div>

<p>Kristin liked the old facades and pointed out a couple of the sites she had seen there before (she meandered around the town while I was running my half):
<p style="text-align: center;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 417px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_008.jpg"><img class="  " title="Store front" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_008.jpg" alt="Store front" width="417" height="629" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Store front</p></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_011.jpg"><img class="  " title="Horse step" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_011.jpg" alt="Horse step" width="629" height="417" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Horse step</p></div>

<p>Being near Antietam, you can see what must have been the remnants of some defensive action along the Potomac. It's always cool to see this sort of stuff preserved:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_028.jpg"><img class="   " title="Destroyed bridge on the Potomac" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_028.jpg" alt="Destroyed bridge on the Potomac" width="629" height="417" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Destroyed bridge on the Potomac</p></div>

<p>Layla particularly enjoyed being carted around town. She was a total trooper - never making so much as a peep in the several hours that we were meandering around the town and in the coffee shop. She did get a little sweaty, so we decided to stop in the store so she could get some time out of her car seat with Mom and Dad:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_017.jpg"><img class="  " title="Layla and Dad" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_017.jpg" alt="Layla and Dad" width="629" height="417" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Layla and Dad</p></div>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 417px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_014.jpg"><img class="  " title="Layla and Mom" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_014.jpg" alt="Layla and Mom" width="417" height="629" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Layla and Mom</p></div>

<p>As I mentioned before, Shepherdstown is right near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antietam_National_Battlefield">Antietam National Battlefield</a>. Being the Civil War buff that I am, I couldn't resist a visit! This was the second time I'd visited the battlefield and all of its grim history: the battle was the single bloodiest day in American history, with 23,000 men killed or wounded in a single day. A <strong><em>single day</em></strong>! That's unfathomable! It was a sobering experience to walk those fields, to say the least.
<p style="text-align: left;"></p></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_037.jpg"><img class="   " title="Cannon positions" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_037.jpg" alt="Cannon positions" width="629" height="417" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Cannon positions</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">All of those artillery positions were cool, but what really got me was visiting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_Bridge">Burnside's Bridge</a>. I think it's because the bridge is still the <em>actual</em> bridge rather than something arranged by the National Park Service after the fact. Sure, it's been patched over the years, but the core remains the same one that sustained so much action back in September 1862, when the battle occurred. There's even a tree nearby called the "Witnesses Tree" because it survived the battle (when apparently others did not). Very cool indeed!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 629px"><a href="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_042.jpg"><img class="   " title="Burnside's Bridge" src="http://antzucaro.com/20101017WV/WV_042.jpg" alt="Burnside's Bridge" width="629" height="417" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Burnside&#39;s Bridge</p></div>

<p style="text-align: left;">After I stopped by the bridge for a few pictures, we rushed over to the observation tower near the center of the battlefield so I could get some panoramas of the overall landscape before leaving. Those pictures (along with some other panoramas I took in Shepherdstown) will have to wait for now, as they take more time to post-process - look forward to all of those at some point in the future! After taking those, we had to hurry home so Layla could get some sleep. Our timing was a little off after a bit of unexpected traffic around Harper's Ferry, so she got a little grumpy in the car on the way. Nothing that a little bit 'o Mom + bottle couldn't handle! Bottle in mouth, she calmed down for the rest of the trip and  arrived home almost ready to pass out. It was a big day for us all, but especially for her. She hung onto Mom and Dad for another hour before succumbing to the call of lala-land. Kristin and I ate dinner, then plopped on the couch for some much needed football time. Weekend, complete!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Update 10/29/2010: Here's the whole gallery of pictures taken that day, including the panoramas I posted later!</p>

  <p>Yesterday on my almost daily walks around Reston Town Center I spotted two new sculptures cropping up in the park across from the Rolls Royce building. From the signs nearby they are made out of recycled wood posts.
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 471px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-198 " title="RTC sculpture 1" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/06/RTC_sculpture_1.jpg" alt="RTC sculpture 1" width="471" height="630" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The first new sculpture in RTC, fully assembled.</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is pretty cool how they are propping the red sculpture up - a clue as  to how it may look when finished? I don't know, but it looks good. Here's a picture taken a little while later (the next afternoon):</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>

<p>It doesn't look like they've made much progress, but we'll find out in due time.</p></p>

  <p>The next time you are walking around and something catches your eye, stop and think about <em><strong>exactly</strong></em> what it was that caused you to stop. It may not be immediately apparent to your conscious mind, but your subconscious knows what it's doing. Trust it! Give yourself some time to absorb the scene and you'll be rewarded with a better picture. It may not come to you immediately, but with practice you'll begin to be able to identify the key points in a scene that initially drew your eye to it.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what I'm talking about. Today I went to my local <a href="http://www.dama-ncr.org/">DAMA</a> meeting, which was held out in D.C. near Union Station. As soon as I got off of the escalator and outside into the weather (cold and dreary), I was greeted with beautiful light, arches, and patterns:</p>

<p>Taking this scene in for a bit, what really drew my eye wasn't the brick patterns. It wasn't really the light in any particular spot either - it was a drab day and the light was diffused everywhere. Focusing on those things as the collective subject creates a rather uninspiring image that looks like it could have been taken anywhere D.C.:
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_06.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-165 " title="Patterns and light on a drab day" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_06.jpg" alt="Patterns and light on a drab day" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Patterns and light on a drab day</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Thinking a bit more, the real pattern popped out to me. What was catching my eye was the progression of archways into an almost-vanishing point far down the walkway. Tightening up my composition to just include those elements makes the picture much more compelling:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-167 " title="Light at the end of the tunnel" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_02.jpg" alt="Light at the end of the tunnel" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Light at the end of the tunnel</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here's another example from later in the day. After my meeting finished up, I headed down to the <a href="http://www.npg.si.edu/">National Portrait Gallery</a> near the Verizon Center. The interior of the building is like a hollowed-out box, with the middle being an enclosed courtyard where you can hang out or get a bite to eat. I loved the look of the courtyard - especially its unique roof:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-169 " title="Kogod Courtyard" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_05.jpg" alt="Kogod Courtyard" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kogod Courtyard</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That roof is really nice, but what drew my eye to it was that curve in the far distance. It is mesmerizing! I zoomed my camera in to get a better view of just that peculiar angle, which resulted in this:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 472px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-171 " title="That interesting curved roof" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_04.jpg" alt="That interesting curved roof" width="472" height="630" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That interesting curved roof</p></div>

<p></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">By sitting back and taking in the scene, I was able to grab a couple of good ones today. Oh, and I got to say hello to John Brown in the process - look at that gnarly beard!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 630px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-173 " title="John Brown and his beard" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/05/DC_07.jpg" alt="John Brown and his beard" width="630" height="472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">John Brown and his beard</p></div>

  <p>Another weekend, another Leesburg trip! The town just has so much to offer. <a href="http://www.antzucaro.com/2010/04/awesome-chalk-art/">Previously</a> I'd mentioned the awesome coffee shop that I am just <em>compelled</em> to visit each time I'm there. Here's part of the reason why: not only do they have excellent coffee, but they are also steeped in local history. According to <a href="http://www.talkloudoun.com/walking-in-their-footsteps-three-generations-of-shoes" target="_blank">Talk Loudon</a>, the window countertops at the front of the store were made from the original shoe shine stand and the bookcases inside were assembled from shoe shelves. During their recent renovation they found some 1920s-era shoes that now hang from the center chandelier. Adorning the front entrance is what appears to be the original shoe repair sign, which I just love:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 225px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0067_1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-111" title="The Shoes coffee shop sign." src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0067_1-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Shoes Cup &amp; Cork Club sign</p></div>

<p>Something in me also loves old signage, and this is about as good as it gets.</p>
<p>Around the side you'll find an alleyway to their back, "secret" garden:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/alley_1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-120" title="Alley to the secret garden" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/alley_1-300x210.jpg" alt="Alley to the secret garden" width="300" height="210" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Alley to the secret garden</p></div>

<p>Besides coffee, the shop sells food which can be enjoyed on their back patio (at the end of the alley above), which is also eloquent. I especially like the lighting up above and the surrounding old buildings:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0061_1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-116" title="Overhead lighting" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/IMG_0061_1-300x225.jpg" alt="Overhead lighting" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Overhead lighting in the secret garden</p></div>
