title: New sculptures in RTC
---
Yesterday on my almost daily walks around Reston Town Center I spotted two new sculptures cropping up in the park across from the Rolls Royce building. From the signs nearby they are made out of recycled wood posts.

<p style="text-align: left;">It is pretty cool how they are propping the red sculpture up - a clue as  to how it may look when finished? I don't know, but it looks good. Here's a picture taken a little while later (the next afternoon):</p>

It doesn't look like they've made much progress, but we'll find out in due time.</p>
