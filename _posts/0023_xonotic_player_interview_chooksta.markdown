title: 'Xonotic Player Interview: chooksta'
---
I am happy to announce the first (of many, hopefully) player interviews, where you can hear players respond to my questions while you watch a sample of their actual gameplay. In this one I talk with chooksta, who is known to all of us in the Xonotic community as both a nice guy and a talented musician. We talk about how he first came to play the game, his music, and what he's looking forward to in Xonotic. The gameplay sample is from a game on "mentalrespace" on an Australian server. I hope you all enjoy!
