Layla turned one today! It has been a wonderful year and both Kristin and I are looking forward to many more with our awesome babes. We're continually surprised with how smart, funny, and happy Layla is. 

Nanny and Pa were present for the festivities (which amounted to hanging around the house). They gave Layla her first birthday present (a narrated book), laughing as she focused more on the wrapping paper and bag than the actual gift inside. Once she figured out that the book talked when it was opened, though, she was hooked. She spent a good amount of time opening and closing the book to make the voices start and stop.

We thought some sweets were in order for this special occasion (normally she doesn't ever have any sweets), so Kristin went out to the store and grabbed some cupcakes for everyone to share. So as not to ruin the new dress (also graciously provided by Nanny and Pa - thank you!) we stripped her down for the carnage. The moment we brought out the cupcake she locked eyes on it.

Before Kristin even set the thing down on the tray she had her hands in the icing.

At first I don't think she knew it was food. She picked it up and squeezed it in her hands like it was just a new toy.

In the end, of course, she realized that it was food. Sweet food!

She dove into the cupcake like a tenured sugar addict...

...not caring the slightest about her appearance.

Once done and satisfied she thought her situation over...

...and came to the conclusion that she had a great first birthday.

When all was said and done she looked like she was storing images of that cupcake in her head for later enjoyment. Well, either that or she was having a sugar crash!

Thank you very much Gram, Nanny, and Pa for their gifts and well-wishes! Thanks also for allowing Kristin and I to sneak in a date night while they watched the little one. It was a weekend to remember.
