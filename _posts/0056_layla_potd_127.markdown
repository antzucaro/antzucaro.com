As I mentioned in a previous post, it is getting <em>really</em> cold here in the outskirts of DC! We went from the mid-70s to below freezing in a matter of two weeks. Thanks, old man winter!

To deal with that cold weather we got a warm wrap for Layla's car seat to keep her insulated during her brief trips outside:
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>


<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101207_080748.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-547" title="Layla's cocoon" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/12/IMG_20101207_080748-e1291738432272-764x1024.jpg" alt="Layla's cocoon" width="450" height="603" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Layla&#39;s cocoon</p></div>

Having this thing keeps her extra warm and protected from the biting wind when she's on her way to or from the car. It's a bonus that she likes to play "where's Layla?" with it!
