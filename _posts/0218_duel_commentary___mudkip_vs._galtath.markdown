Over the past few months I've been playing Xonotic less and less but
developing more and more. This has started to change a little bit with the arrival of some consistent North American players. Where there once was just srkdy, nifrek, and myself, I am now seeing more activity on the servers at night, particularly around 9-10PM. Galtath and mudkip are two examples of such players, and I've been fortunate enough to spectate them multiple times. On one particular night they had a great back-and-forth match on bloodrun that I subsequently commentated. Enjoy!
