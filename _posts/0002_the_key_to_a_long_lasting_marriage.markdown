title: The Key to a Long Lasting Marriage
---
Apparently the key to a long lasting marriage is by keeping track of it through <a href="http://www.theknot.com">The Knot</a>. Kristin uses the site to get to our guest list data, which the site happily stores for us. Isn't that nice? Here's what the home screen looked like when she logged on recently.

Relatively benign, right? Wait a minute...something isn't right here! Let's take a closer look.

So we've been married for 733,769 days, or <strong>over 2,008 years</strong>. Go us!
