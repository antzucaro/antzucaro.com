title: Here comes winter
---
As I look down at my desktop calendar, I'm completely surprised that it's the end of November <em>already</em>. Time truly does fly when you're having fun, and apparently even more so when you are having fun with an infant!

Kristin doesn't welcome the upcoming winter season, but I certainly do. The different season really gives the days a new feel for me, given that it is dark when I leave for work <em>and</em> when I come home. One benefit of this is getting to see the Reston Town Center skyline as I head out the office door - it makes me feel like I work in Manhatten, as opposed to the 6 square blocks (or so) of RTC:

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/RTC_nov.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-527" title="The view of the SW corner of RTC" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/11/RTC_nov-1024x764.jpg" alt="The view of the SW corner of RTC" width="450" height="335" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The view of the SW corner of RTC</p></div>

Granted, the downside is that it's starting to get really cold. In fact, The DC area doesn't seem to have much of a fall season at all - we just go from 90 degree weather down to 40s in a span of two weeks. That's okay, though. I can always put on more layers as the mercury levels drop, whereas in the summer it isn't as socially acceptable to remove too many layers :).
