We've signed Layla up for some pool classes at our local community center, hoping to acclimate her to being in the water as much as possible. It seems like we didn't need to do that at all from her first couple of experiences - she's absolutely loving it! Far from staying docile in the water like many other babies in the same cohort, Layla splashes and sqeals with delight for the entire half hour that she's in the water. It is almost as if we didn't need all the props and games to keep her entertained. Just being in the water with Mom or Dad (or both) would suit her just fine! I think before long she's going to be on a swim team given how much fun she's having. 

We start off the class right around 10am with all of the parents jumping in w/ their kids. Fortunately the room is humid and warm, so the water is no shock whatsoever (albeit somewhat less refreshing):

I was hoping the class would vary up the routines, but this week (our second) they did the same routines and songs as last time. Layla doesn't seem to mind:

Parents are free to roam about the rather large pool area as they see fit. Here Mommy and Layla come in close for a shot:

It is also a great thing to have other kids her age around in the pool. Even though she seems to be in her own world I'm glad Layla can observe other kids if she wants to.

I liked this one when Kristin and Layla had their backs to me. They were having a good bonding session in the water together:

Another one of the props they give the babies to play is a bucket. The possibilities expand with that in hand! Take note also that we've put her hair up into two pig tales that we call "whale spouts" for the occasion. We figured it would keep her hair out of her face. Plus, it's cute!

Everyone concludes the class by going down the slide. Here they are about to go down:

Even though the class is only a half hour it is enough to get Layla exhausted. Here she is right near the exit steps for some final contemplations before drying off and putting on a new diaper:

Once home she passed out for a solid 2 hours! Great fun and great sleep. What more could I ask for?
