This was the second year we brought Layla with us to Lake Anna. While last time she was only a few months old and not able to do much of anything, this year she was all over the place! She had a blast playing with two new dogs and investigating everyone's things strewn about the lake house. 

A big milestone for this week is her walking ability. She's now able to stand by herself and walk clear across the room, where before she could only stand with help and would fall down after 5 or 6 steps! It's truly amazing to watch and I'm very proud of her progress. As you can see she's happy with herself as well!
