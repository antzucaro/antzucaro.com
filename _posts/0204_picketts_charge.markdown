I did something I hadn't done before on this past weekend's trip to Gettysburg battlefield: I walked the line of Pickett's charge! I find it unbelievable that thousands of troops walked this path in the direct line of fire of lots of artillery directly to their front. No wonder they were decimated! Walking this same path well over a century later I still felt exposed and vulnerable.
