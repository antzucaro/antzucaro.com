This is from last weekend, where we got a slight dusting of snow. I like it for perhaps the first few hours, but thereafter I just want it gone. Snow used to be such a rare occurrence (when I lived in Hampton Roads), but now it's commonplace. Of course the kids and especially the dog love it - they don't have to commute in it! Me, I just go out at first light and take some shots while the sights are still favorable in my mind.
