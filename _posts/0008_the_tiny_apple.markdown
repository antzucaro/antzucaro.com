With all of the diet gimmicks in the world, everyone seems to forget that there is another option to lose weight: <em><strong>just eat less</strong></em>. Well, almost everyone - Panera Bread seems to get the concept. They offer apples as a low-calorie alternative to their chips. How low-cal you ask? Take a look for yourself:

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/tiny_panera_apple_01.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-125" title="Teeny tiny Panera apple" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/tiny_panera_apple_01-300x224.jpg" alt="Teeny tiny Panera apple" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A teeny tiny Panera apple</p></div>

Are my eyes just playing a trick on me or is that a <em><strong>really</strong></em> tiny apple? Hmm, let me check - ah, yes! I brought my own apple as a snack today for comparison:

<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/tiny_panera_apple_02.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-126" title="My apple (on the right) vs. Panera apple" src="http://media.antzucaro.com/uploads/2010/04/tiny_panera_apple_02-300x224.jpg" alt="My apple (on the right) vs. Panera apple" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">My apple (on the right) vs. Panera apple</p></div>

Mind you that my "reference" apple isn't exactly a monster. It is just a  run-of-the-mill gala from the store. I could sit the pipsqueak on the left next to a red delicious if I really wanted to embarrass it.
